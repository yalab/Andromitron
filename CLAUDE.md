# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Andromitron is an Android application for implementing a local HTTPS proxy with domain-based filtering capabilities. The project aims to create a VPN-based proxy service that can filter network traffic at the system level.

## Development Commands

### Build and Development
```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install debug APK on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run unit tests for debug build
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Run instrumented tests (requires connected device/emulator)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "net.yalab.andromitron.ExampleUnitTest"
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run lint checks
./gradlew lint

# Generate lint report
./gradlew lintDebug
```

## Project Architecture

### Core Components (Implemented)
Based on the specification in `android_proxy_spec.md`:

- **VPN Service**: ✅ System-level traffic capture using Android's VPNService
- **Filter Engine**: ✅ Domain-based filtering logic (blocklist/whitelist)
- **TUN Interface**: ✅ Network packet processing
- **Database Layer**: ✅ Room database for storing blocklists and logs
- **UI Layer**: ✅ Jetpack Compose interface with Material3
- **Network Layer**: ⚠️ Basic structure (needs full integration)

### Current State (Fully Implemented)
- ✅ Complete Android project structure with comprehensive architecture
- ✅ Package: `net.yalab.andromitron`
- ✅ Target SDK: 36, Min SDK: 35
- ✅ Kotlin-based development with coroutines
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- ✅ VPN service with packet processing integration
- ✅ Domain filtering with exact and wildcard matching
- ✅ Network packet analysis (IPv4, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS/TLS)
- ✅ Room database with DAOs and entities
- ✅ Complete Jetpack Compose UI with Material3 design

### Key Technical Approaches
1. **VPNService + TUN Interface**: Primary method for system-wide traffic interception
2. **DNS-level blocking**: For HTTPS traffic filtering
3. **SNI parsing**: Extract domain names from TLS handshakes
4. **Hybrid filtering**: Combination of DNS monitoring and SNI analysis

### Required Permissions (Implemented)
- ✅ `BIND_VPN_SERVICE` - VPN service binding
- ✅ `INTERNET` - Network access
- ✅ `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Background service operation
- ✅ `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` - VPN-specific foreground service
